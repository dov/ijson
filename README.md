# Background

ijson is an "interactive" json module. In contrast to the standard json library,
it provides completion of the json keys in the dictionaries, which makes 
interactive exploring faster. (Similar to how completion in pandas works).

# Syntax

The syntax is identical to the json library, and is implemented as a thin 
wrapper on top of it.
  
# Development
